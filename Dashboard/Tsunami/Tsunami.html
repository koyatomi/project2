        <div class="row">

                <p>A tsunami (pronounced soo-NAHM-ee) is a series of huge waves that occur as the result of a violent
                    underwater disturbance, such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption. The waves travel in all
                    directions from the epicenter of the disturbance. The waves may travel in the open sea as fast as
                    450 miles per hour. As they travel in the open ocean, tsunami waves are generally not particularly large—hence the difficulty in
                    detecting the approach of a tsunami. But as these powerful waves approach shallow waters along the coast, their velocity is
                    slowed and they consequently grow to a great height before smashing into the shore. They can grow as
                    high as 100 feet; the Indian Ocean tsunami generated waves reaching 30 feet. There are three:
                    inundation, wave impact on structures, and erosion. Strong, tsunami-induced currents lead to the
                    erosion of foundations and the collapse of bridges and seawalls. Flotation and drag forces move
                    houses and overturn railroad cars. Considerable damage is caused by the resultant floating debris,
                    including boats and cars that become dangerous projectiles that may crash into buildings, break
                    power lines, and may start fires. Fires from damaged ships in ports or from ruptured coastal oil
                    storage tanks and refinery facilities, can cause damage greater than that inflicted directly by the
                    tsunami.<br>Developing countries are most exposed to the risks of disasters as their inhabitants
                    often lack the ability to cope with or adapt to such events, especially in the case of re-occurring
                    disasters. As more than half the world’s population lives in cities, poorly planned and managed
                    urban development is a key driver of disaster risk. Poor housing, lack of health facilities and
                    infrastructure put nearly one billion urban dwellers living in informal settlements at risk of
                    disasters. The lives and livelihoods of people living in flood plains, low lying coastal areas and
                    steep slopes are particularly in danger.<br>(https://www.infoplease.com/world/)
